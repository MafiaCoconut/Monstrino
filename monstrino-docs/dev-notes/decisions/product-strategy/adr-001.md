## Context

Early authentication work did not provide value without stable domain data.
User features depended on unreliable core information.

---

## Decision

Defer authentication and user features until the release catalog
and ingestion pipeline reached stability.

---

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- Faster domain stabilization
- Reduced rework
- Clear development focus

### ⚠️ Negative
- Delayed user-facing features

### 🎯 Accepted Trade-off

> Domain correctness over early user onboarding.
