title: ADR-007 — Contracts, Commands, and Dispatcher Boundary
sidebar_label: ADR-007 Contracts to Commands
---

> **Status:** Accepted  
> **Scope:** Application boundary design  
> **Audience:** Engineering / Architecture review

---

## Context

External API contracts should not leak into application logic.
Direct coupling would limit evolution and validation.

---

## Decision

Introduce a strict boundary:

HTTP Contract → Mapper → Command → Dispatcher → Use Case

Each layer has a single responsibility and explicit transformation.

---

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- Clear application boundaries
- Improved testability
- Stable public contracts

### ⚠️ Negative
- Additional mapping code

### 🎯 Accepted Trade-off

> Boundary clarity over implementation brevity.
