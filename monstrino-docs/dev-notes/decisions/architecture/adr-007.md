title: ADR-011 — Early Price Data Collection Before Product Launch
sidebar_label: ADR-011 — Early Price Collection
---

## Status
Accepted

---

## Context

Monstrino’s public product release is not imminent, but the **value of price history is time-dependent**:
the earlier we start collecting prices, the more historical coverage we can provide later.

Price data has multiple long-term use cases:
- showing **original retail price** (per country/currency),
- showing **secondary market price** (per platform/country/currency),
- building **price history** and trend analytics,
- enabling future comparisons like “price on specific marketplace” and “typical listing price range”.

If we postpone price collection until the UI or user features are ready, we will permanently lose
historical coverage. Many sources do not provide reliable backfills.

At the same time, price collection has different operational properties than core catalog ingestion:
- frequent polling / scheduled crawling,
- many external sources with unstable formats,
- high chance of partial failures and rate limiting,
- long-term storage of time-series-like data.

This makes price collection a distinct subsystem that should not be tightly coupled to UI delivery.

## Decision

Start building a dedicated service **market-price-collector** as early as possible to begin collecting price data
before the main product launch.

Key points:
- Price collection is treated as a **separate ingestion pipeline**.
- The system prioritizes **early accumulation of historical data** over immediate user-facing value.
- The service will collect and persist:
  - **original retail prices** (when available) per country/currency/source,
  - **secondary market prices / listings** per marketplace/country/currency,
  - **time-stamped observations** to support history and analytics.
- UI display and user features remain out of scope for this decision.

---

## Alternatives Considered

### A) Wait until Monstrino UI / public release is ready
Rejected because:
- the system would lose months of historical coverage,
- backfilling later is unreliable or impossible for many sources.

### B) Implement price collection inside existing catalog ingestion services
Rejected because:
- mixes unrelated responsibilities (catalog ingestion vs market pricing),
- increases coupling and risk of regressions in core catalog pipeline,
- price crawling has different schedules, failure modes, and scaling needs.

### C) Manual collection and later import
Rejected because:
- does not scale beyond a small subset of releases/sources,
- produces inconsistent coverage and cannot support continuous updates.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Price history begins accumulating immediately, increasing long-term product value.
- Clear separation of concerns: catalog ingestion remains focused on canonical release data.
- Operational isolation: failures and source instability in price crawling do not affect core catalog processing.
- Enables future features (price history charts, country comparison, marketplace-specific views) with minimal rework.

### Negative
- Additional service and operational surface area earlier in the project lifecycle.
- Requires designing a storage model suitable for multi-source, multi-currency, time-stamped observations.
- External sources may be unstable, rate-limited, or legally constrained; reliability and compliance work is required.

## Notes

- This ADR does not define the final database schema for pricing.
  A follow-up ADR may be created for:
  - canonical price domain model,
  - time-series storage strategy,
  - deduplication and normalization rules,
  - source reliability scoring and data quality metadata.
- Service Reality documentation will be added once the service has a stable runtime behavior.
