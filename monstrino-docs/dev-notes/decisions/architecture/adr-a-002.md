## Context

SQLAlchemy ORM objects carry session state, lazy-loading behavior, and persistence metadata. When these objects escape the repository layer and spread into application logic, use cases, or API handlers, it causes:

- Business logic coupled to persistence details.
- Session leaks and unexpected lazy-loading in non-database contexts.
- Difficult and fragile unit tests.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: ORM Objects Everywhere

Allow ORM entities to flow freely through all layers.

- **Pros:** Convenient, less mapping boilerplate.
- **Cons:** Business logic becomes coupled to SQLAlchemy, lazy-loading causes hidden queries, testing requires real database sessions.

### Option 2: ORM Restricted to Repository Layer ✅

ORM objects are used only inside repository implementations. Application and domain layers use DTOs, commands, and plain data structures.

- **Pros:** Clean architecture boundaries, testable business logic without DB, free to change ORM without touching application code.
- **Cons:** Additional DTO mapping layer required.

## Decision

> **SQLAlchemy ORM entities may only be instantiated and used inside repository implementations.** Application layer, use cases, dispatchers, and API handlers must work exclusively with DTOs, commands, and domain data classes.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Application logic is persistence-agnostic and unit-testable.
- ORM schema changes do not propagate into business logic.
- Clean separation of concerns.

### Negative

- Mapping between ORM entities and DTOs introduces boilerplate.
