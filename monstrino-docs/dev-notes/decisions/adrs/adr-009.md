> **Status:** Accepted  
> **Scope:** Data enrichment  
> **Audience:** Engineering / Architecture review

---

## Context

Some release metadata is ambiguous or semi-structured.
Rule-based processing alone was insufficient.

---

## Decision

Introduce an **LLM gateway** as an assistive, non-critical processing step.

---

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- Improved data enrichment
- Flexible interpretation

### ⚠️ Negative
- Non-deterministic outputs
- Requires isolation from core logic

### 🎯 Accepted Trade-off

> Assisted enrichment without core dependency.
