## Context

Repositories form the backbone of persistence logic.
Testing them indirectly via services made failures hard to localize.

---

## Decision

Introduce a dedicated **sandbox-service** to run standardized repository tests
using shared fixtures.

---

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- Fast feedback on persistence correctness
- Uniform test coverage
- Reduced debugging time

### ⚠️ Negative
- Additional service to maintain

### 🎯 Accepted Trade-off

> Infrastructure test clarity over minimal project size.
