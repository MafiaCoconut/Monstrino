> **Status:** Accepted  
> **Scope:** Infrastructure  
> **Audience:** Engineering / Architecture review

## Context

The project is deployed on a single-node homelab environment.
Full multi-cluster setups would be excessive.

---

## Decision

Use **k3s** with namespace separation for test and production environments.

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- Lightweight infrastructure
- Clear environment isolation
- Low operational overhead

### ⚠️ Negative
- Shared node risks

### 🎯 Accepted Trade-off

> Operational simplicity over full isolation.
